Sorting and Adding

First start the server in a terminal:
 
Server.py

Open the client terminal and from them try the following commands:

1.Asyncrhonous
  Client_Asadd.py
  Client_Assort.py

2.Synchronous
  Client_Syadd.py
  Client_sysort.py


The computations done for addition are stored in addition_Computations.db and for sorting are stored in sorted_Computations.db.
